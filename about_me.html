        <p>Hi! Welcome, I'm Eva Pols. I can be the driest person you have ever met, which also means that good humor is important to me. I also like to make designs that make people
            smile, while at first glance you would think that I like dark and spooky stuff. Well, that is also true, I like dark and spooky stuff. That is also why music is very
            important to me, I like pop, rock and metal music. Like, pretty dark music stuff. But something that isn't dark and spooky is my pink car, if you look around on my page
            you can find her somewhere. I like working in teams, like driving people to get some ice cream. Or working together on a project. I can also work independently on some
            3D models or designs. Before my study at the HVA I studied Game Artist at MediaCollege, that is why you can see some of one of my previous skills â€” well, one of my skills I
            still happily work on. But at the HVA I am working on expanding my experience.
            <br> So, if you want someone who you can build on, laugh with, or grab a coffee with, you know where to find me!
